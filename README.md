# DM!, the Discord Chatbot
The public "Discord Minigames!" Github repository, this is unfinished.

If you would like to continue this bot, you are free to do so as long as I get credited properly somewhere where people can see this repository, my discord name and discriminator.

Enjoy!

## How to use for yourself?
```
Step 1: Download the repository files using the "CODE" tab and clicking on "Download ZIP".
Step 2: Create a folder and extract the ZIP inside.
Step 3: Build your own bot on the discord developer portal, and grab the BOT TOKEN.
Step 4: Invite the bot to your server using the OAUTH generator.
Step 5: Navigate to the last line in the file "main.py" and replace the string with your token.
Step 6: Run main.py and have fun!
```
